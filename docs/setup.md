# Setup and project layout

Chrome Bridge is published from the canonical GitHub repository `wolfiesch/chrome-bridge`. Your local checkout directory may have a different name; commands in this document assume you are running from the repository root.

`setup.sh` generates `bridge_token.txt` (0600 shared secret), installs `bridge_policy.json` from `bridge_policy.example.json` when absent, deploys a local keyed extension manifest, and writes `com.automation.bridge.json`. `setup-rs.sh` additionally generates `com.automation.bridge.rust.json` and the `bridge-host-launch.sh` wrapper. The optional `bridge_tokens.txt` named-token registry (see Multi-client tokens and leasing) is also a local secret. All of these are git-ignored and stay local. Keep Python files out of Chrome-loaded extension directories: running them creates `__pycache__`, and Chrome refuses folders containing `_`-prefixed names.

## Components

| File | Role |
|---|---|
| `extension/manifest.json` | Public unkeyed MV3 source manifest. `setup.sh` and `deploy.sh --with-local-key` write a keyed copy into the local extension directory for a deterministic unpacked ID. |
| `extension/background.js` | Service worker: connects to the native host, runs browser actions, and uses `chrome.alarms` plus heartbeat messages to self-heal after idle or sleep. |
| `wake.html`, `wake.js` | Legacy explicit recovery page retained for packaging compatibility. The CLI and broker never open it during routine retries. |
| `bridge.py` | Native host. Talks to Chrome over stdio and exposes a token-gated TCP server on `127.0.0.1:9223` for local clients. |
| `com.automation.bridge.json.template` | Host-manifest template. `setup.sh` substitutes the absolute host path and local or packaged extension ID. |
| `test_client.py` | Positional CLI client (`python3 test_client.py <action> ...`). |
| `.github/workflows/ci.yml` | Pull-request and `main` push gates for syntax, offline contracts, Rust parity, benchmarks, and packaging checks. |
| `.github/workflows/release.yml` | Tag-driven release workflow for `v*` tags after the CI command set passes. |
| `scripts/package_release.py` | Stdlib release packager for source archives, unpacked extension bundles, and Rust host binaries. |

## Requirements

- Google Chrome, Chrome Beta, or Chromium with Developer mode. The macOS installer also registers Chrome Canary.
- Python 3.9+ for the core bridge and CLI; Python 3.10+ for the MCP server (`mcp/`, matching `mcp/pyproject.toml`).
- macOS or Linux for the documented `setup.sh` and `setup-rs.sh` native-host installers. Broker mode and `setup-broker.sh` are macOS-only because they use launchd. Other platforms may be possible with manual Chrome native-host registration, but they are not covered by these installers.

## Setup

Default local install:

```bash
./setup.sh
```

The script generates or reuses `extension_key.pem`, deploys `background.js` plus a keyed manifest into a per-user extension directory, registers the native host for that deterministic extension ID, creates `bridge_token.txt` when absent, and installs `bridge_policy.json` from the example template when absent. It prints the extension directory at the end.

Then:

1. Open `chrome://extensions/` and enable Developer mode.
2. Load unpacked: the extension directory printed by `./setup.sh`.
3. Enable only one bridge extension at a time. Duplicate bridge extensions race to bind port `9223`.
4. Verify:
   ```bash
   python3 test_client.py ping
   python3 test_client.py policyCheck getTabs '{}'
   ```
   Expected: `ping` succeeds. `policyCheck getTabs '{}'` is allowed when setup installed the example policy.

Advanced setup:

```bash
./setup.sh --extension-id <id>
```

Use this for an already-packaged or future Web Store extension ID. It registers that packaged/store extension ID separately and does not generate or inject a local extension key for the developer-mode unpacked copy.

```bash
cargo build --release --manifest-path host-rs/Cargo.toml
./setup-rs.sh
```

Use this to register the Rust host with the same extension-ID resolution flow.

## Launchd broker mode

Broker mode is optional on macOS. launchd keeps a small Python broker listening on public port `9223`; Chrome-launched Python or Rust native hosts bind backend port `19223`. Clients keep using `BRIDGE_PORT=9223`, or no override. On first install, `setup-broker.sh` seeds the state-dir token from the repo token so the existing `chrome-bridge` CLI keeps working; if both token files already exist and differ, the script warns and clients should set `BRIDGE_TOKEN_FILE` to the state token path.

Install Python-host broker mode:

```bash
./setup-broker.sh --host python
```

Install Rust-host broker mode after building Rust:

```bash
cargo build --release --manifest-path host-rs/Cargo.toml
./setup-broker.sh --host rust
```

After setup completes, load the state-dir extension path printed by `setup-broker.sh` and disable any older bridge extension. Broker mode uses state under `~/Library/Application Support/chrome-native-bridge` by default, including its own extension key, extension ID, token, policy, and launcher. If you are migrating from a repo-local install, reload exactly the printed state-dir extension so the loaded extension ID matches the broker native-host registration.

Verify the broker process and public endpoint:

```bash
launchctl print gui/$UID/gg.wolfie.chrome-native-bridge.broker
chrome-bridge ping
```

Disable broker mode:

```bash
./uninstall-broker.sh
```

`extension_key.pem` is a private local identity key for the developer-mode unpacked extension. Keep it git-ignored and never commit it. A packaged or Web Store extension has a separate store-managed ID; register that ID with `./setup.sh --extension-id <store-id>`.

## Troubleshooting

The host writes a local `bridge_debug.log` (git-ignored) next to `bridge.py`:

```bash
tail -f bridge_debug.log
```

Run `python3 scripts/diagnose_install.py` for a read-only comparison of repository and deployed files plus broker/backend connection state. It never launches Chrome or opens a tab.

- `Connection refused` after retry in direct mode: Chrome is closed, no bridge extension is enabled, or the native connection is down. Routine retries never open Chrome or create a tab. Open Chrome normally, then inspect the extension service worker and `bridge_debug.log`.
- MCP says `server not connected` while `chrome-bridge ping` works: update to a build containing the packaged-startup path fix, then restart the MCP client once so it launches the corrected server. The MCP package now adds `BRIDGE_REPO_ROOT` before importing repo-local helpers and retries one safe pre-send connection failure automatically; a separate `PYTHONPATH` entry is no longer required.
- `Connection refused` in broker mode: launchd broker is not loaded. Run `launchctl print gui/$UID/gg.wolfie.chrome-native-bridge.broker`.
- `broker backend unavailable: native host did not start`: broker is up, but Chrome, the extension, or the native host did not connect within `BRIDGE_BROKER_BACKEND_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`. The broker returns `status: browser_unavailable` without opening Chrome. Reload the extension and check `broker_debug.log` plus `bridge_debug.log`.
- `FATAL: could not bind 127.0.0.1:9223`: two direct-mode bridge extensions are enabled, or direct mode is racing the broker.
- `unauthorized`: token mismatch, or the native-host manifest authorized the wrong extension ID. Re-run `./setup.sh`, reload the printed extension directory, and disable duplicate bridge extensions.
